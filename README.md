# Modules and Classes

This app is to learn more about modules and classes

I may try out the Underscrore Library on this project...

## String Module

This module takes string arguments from the command line and manipulates them and then returns the changed array.

Right now it rearranges the letters and add some to the middle.

It is in string1.js

This is an ES Module so the import and export were as follows:

    // string1.js
    const strChange = function {}

    export {strChange}

    // app.js
    import {strChange} from "./string1.js"

I want to create other modules or add functions to this module.

### Functions to add

1. Rearrange the words
2. flip the first and last letter
3.
